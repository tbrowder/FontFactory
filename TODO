create bin/ff-download to:
  create and download a font sample PDF
  download the license files
  download examples

DONE: Test font loading

DONE: Finish Config file check: warn but DO NOT MODIFY

Finish docs (explain config check)

DONE: have to show license

DONE: YES!!Do resources files have to be in META6.json? check installed  YES!!!

option to print a font sampler PDF doc
+ see FontFactory

Subs to build:
  locate-font
  install-config (paths to font files)
  get-resource-content $path
  # from docs:

  # To actually use the file's content, the user can extract it as a
  # string in another routine in the same module:
  sub get-resource-content {
      say $?DISTRIBUTION.content('lib/MyFoo.rakumod').open.slurp;
      # OUTPUT: «unit module MyFoo;␤»
  }


DONE: Add the MICR font to be installed
+ put in /resources
  - Build.rakumod
  - install in $HOME/.FreeFont/*
    (unless it's already there
+ add doc stuff from FFT1

Decide on the interface details:
  the user asks for a font by
    code
    code2
    number
    name (with or without spaces)
    adobe name (with or without spaces)
  the factory first looks in its
    hash to see if there is already a font object
    if not,
      find the path,
        check the user's home dir first
        if not
          use :find-font
          update user's home dir
      load the font
      and reference it in the hash

    the hash is %fonts with a number key
      with a value of the object

another option should be downloading the GNU file archive 
  directly and unpacking   it
