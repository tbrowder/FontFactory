Use system locate instead of find-font
  for finding Free Font .otf files
  - how to do on Mac and Win?

Subs to build:
  locate-font
  install-config (paths to font files)

Add the MICR font to be installed
+ put in /resources
  - Build.rakumod
  - install in $HOME/.FreeFont/*
    (unless it's already there
+ add doc stuff from FFT1

Decide on the interface details:
  the user asks for a font by
    code
    code2
    number
    name (with or without spaces)
    adobe name (with or without spaces)
  the factory first looks in its
    hash to see if there is already a font object
    if not, 
      find the path, 
        check the user's home dir first
        if not
          use :find-font 
          update user's home dir
      load the font
      and reference it in the hash

    the hash is %fonts with a number key
      with a value of the object

another option should be downloading the GNU file archive directly and unpacking   it
