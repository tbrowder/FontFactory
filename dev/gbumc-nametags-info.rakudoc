=TITLE GBUMC Name Tags: The Project

=DATE 2024-09-16

=head1 Part A. Status as of Sunday, 2024-09-15

I will continue to tweak the name tags, and welcome any suggested
changes. I do plan to make the embellishment pattern (aka GBUMC logo)
exactly the same as the one that appears on the bottom-right corner of
today’s bulletin .

=head1 My purpose for producing the name tags

In my advanced age, it is getting harder to remember names. Seeing
congregants with an easily-readable name tag helps recalling the name
for use in conversation. My name tag design fits that requirement.

Importantly, it also identifies one as a GBUMC congregant and is very
suitable for wear at any church-related event, particularly public
events such as Trunk or Treat or other outreach events.

=head1 Unique features of my design

1. Dimensions, text, colors, and embellishments are easily changed.

2. If printed correctly on two-sided paper, the same design (and
names) appear even if it is flipped over as happens so often when one
is wearing them.

3. They are cheap to produce: Clear plastic badge holders from Walmart
(including our local "little" Walmart) or Amazon can be bought for 50
cents or less and they have pocket clips included.  Suitable lanyards
are also inexpensive.

4. With the current size of them, eight name tags can printed per sheet
of paper. (I know the church has a good color-capable printer.

5. They are easy to cut out and assemble.

6. Mistakes are readily corrected.

=head1 How I produce the name tags using a free program

I have created a free, publicly available (see details below), Raku
computer language (L<http://Raku.org>) program that creates the two-sided
PDF sheet for US Letter paper in Portrait orientation. The program is
command-line executed on computers running a GNU/Linux operating
system (I use Debian). It should also run on a MacOS system when I
eventually port the program to it using my wife's Mac (that is a low
priority until users request it by filing an issue on GitHub OR
emailing me).

Note the Mac system will have to have some Rakudo and other
prerequisite programs installed (I have one to work with for my use,
but check with your IT person for any computers on the church's
private network).

It is also possible to port it to Windows, but that is not so easy
given the weirdisms of the Windows OS preventing so many prerequistes
from being ported to it.

=head1 The name tag program

The only input required is a list of names in a plain text document
such as a CSV file or a Windows Notepad file. That file is provided as
the only input to the program, and the output is a single PDF document
suitable for printing on almost any modern printer, or viewing in most
modern web browsers.

The input file must be formatted according to these rules (see Notes):

=item one name per line
=item last-name first-name middle-name

=head2 Formatting Notes:

=item names may be separated by spaces or commas
=item the first-name (along with any middle-name) will be printed on the
first line of the name tag
=item the last-name will be printed on the second line of the name tag

=head1 Program

The program source code is publicly available in the /dev directory
of the FontFactory repository in my GitHub account (see
L<https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory>). The program file name is
'make-name-tags.raku'.
