  NAME


  FontFactory
   - Provides convenience classes to ease OpenType and TrueType
font handling in different faces and sizes.


  NOTE
  : The intent is for this module to work on Linux, MacOS, and
Windows.  Please file an issue if you need it on your OS.  The package
requires use of the 'PDF::Font::Loader:ver<0.8.7>' which has recently
been ported to those two systems.


  SYNOPSIS


  use FontFactory;
my $ff = FontFactory.new;
# get a DocFont object for use with PDF documents
my $f1 = $ff.get-font: "t12d5";
say $f1.name:    # OUTPUT: «Free Serif␤»
say $f1.size;    # OUTPUT: «12.5␤»
say $f1.file;    # OUTPUT: «/usr/share/fonts/opentype/freefont/FreeSerif.otf␤»
say $f1.alias;   # OUTPUT: «Times␤»
say $f1.license; # OUTPUT: «GNU GPL V3␤»

  Installation requirements


  The following system packages need to be installed to use all the
features of this module.


  The FontConfig library


  On Debian:

  $ sudo aptitude install fontconfig

  On MacOS:

  $ brew install fontconfig

  On Windows:

  $ choco install fontconfig # if available

  The FontFactory font files


  On Debian:

  $ sudo aptitude install fonts-freefont-otf

  On MacOS:

  $ brew install --cask font-freefont

  On Windows:

  $ choco install font-freefont

  On other systems the files may be downloaded from

  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/freefont
   and installed in any desired
place. The paths to the installed files should then be entered
manually in the 
  $HOME/.FontFactory/Config
   file which is created
upon installation.  That file should look like the following. Note the
only critical parts are the first and last entries on a line. The
first is a number that must be unique in the list, and any entry you
make must be greater than 15. The last item on a line is the path to
the font file on your system.


  The 
  Code
   and 
  Code2
   entries are optional but can be convenient
for you. If used, the entry 
  must
   be unique in that column. If you
use only one code, it is used as a 'Code' entry. Note the file is
checked each time you use this module, and any invalid entry will
cause an error.  In addition, you may use commas instead of spaces to
separate entries on a line.


  The file will alse be checked upon any module update, and existng
valid entries will not be modified.


  # No. Code Code2 Path

  DESCRIPTION


  FontFactory
   is a package that provides easy handling of the set of
GNU FreeFont OpenType fonts which descended from the classic Adobe
Type 1 free fonts shown in Table 2 below. Unlike the original Adobe
fonts, these fonts also include thousands of Unicode characters. The
fonts are also among the few, freely-available fonts that have Type 1
kerning.


  See 
  https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/sources/
   for much more
information on the sources and Unicode coverage of the FontFactory GNU
FreeFonts collection.


  Note the 
  Code
   and 
  Code2
   columns. Each row contains equivalent
code you may use to select the FreeFont face. You can also use the
reference number.


  Table 1


  -----------------------+------+--------------------------

  Table 2


  -----------------------+------+--------------------------

  Notes on the three additional fonts


  Each table above shows three more fonts that are included in the
'/resources' directory, along with several other files, that will be
installed into your '$*HOME/.FontFactory/fonts' or
'$*HOME/.FontFactory/docs' directories, as appropriate.


  The MICR fonts (more formally known as E13B) are designed to produce
the machine-readable numbers found on bank checks in the US and Canada
and other countries around the world, promarily in Asia.


  An equivalent font, CMC7, is used in other countries, primarily South
America and Europe.


  MICRE


  That is a MICRE font in TrueType format ('.ttf').  The
MICR Encoding font, used for bank checks, was obtained from

  1001fonts.com
  .


  The downloaded file was named 
  micr-encoding.zip
   (which was deleted
after unzipping it).  When file 
  micr-encoding.zip
   was unzipped into
an 
  unzipped
   directory, the following files were found:


    '!DigitalGraphicLabs.html'
  '!license.txt'
  micrenc.ttf

  The two files in single quotes were renamed to:


  DigitalGraphicLabs.html
micrenc-license.txt

  and all three files will be installed in your 
'$*HOME/.FontFactory/docs' directory.


  The license basically says the font is free to use for non-commercial
purposes. Consult the license carefully if you do intend to use it
commercially.


  GnuMICR


  This is a GNU version of the MICRE font face, in OpenType format
('.otf'), which 
  can
   be used commercially. See the GNU license in
the 
  COPYING.txt
   file in the '/resources/docs' directory.


  See many more details and supporting files at the author's site at

  .


  CMC7


  This is a free font designed by Harold Lohner, in 1998, and placed
into the public domain by him. It was downloaded from

  https://www.fonts4free.net/cmc-7-font.html
  . See more details and
the license in the 
  CMC7.txt
   file in the '/resources/docs' directory.


  The DocFont class


  The 
  $t12d5
   object shown above in the 
  SYNOPSIS
   section is
actually a 
  DocFont
   object that essentially pairs a

  PDF::Font::Loader::FontObj
   with a 
  size
   attribute. That pairing,
along with suitable naming of the object, can make it easier to manage
font faces for complex documents as shown in a program constructing a
simple PDF page (a copy is in this repository's 'examples' directory):


  #!/usr/bin/env raku
use PDF::Lite;
use PDF::Font::Loader :load-font;
use FontFactory;
use FontFactory::Classes;
my $ff = FontFactory.new;
my $t12d5 = $ff.get-font: "t12d5"; # FreeSerif (Times), 12.5 points
my PDF::Lite $pdf .= new;
$pdf.add-page.text: {
   .font = $t12d.font, $t12d.size; # <== .font, .size (the two required values)
   .text-position = [10, 600];
   .say: "Hello, World!";
}
$pdf.save-as: "ff-example.pdf";

  Binary executable file 
  ff-helper
  


  The program is installed along with the module and can be used to get
access to the module's '/resources/bin' directory.  Executing the file
without arguments shows its options:


  Usage: ff-helper <mode>

Modes:
  s - show /resources contents
  f - download font files
  p - print PDF of font samples
  d - download example programs
  L - download licenses
  a - do all the above

  The 
  DocFont
   class


  The class' attributes are scaled to the chosen size and the class
provides several methods to enable the user to place text precisely on
a PDF page:


  Listing a font's general attributes:


  CapHeight

  Descender

  number of glyphs (characters)


  Listing a string's attributes:


  stringwidth (with or without :kern, :ligatures)
