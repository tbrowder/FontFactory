The /dev program 'installed-resources-testing.raku' is
used to test or prove 
    the META file MUST have resources listed
    to use them WHEN it is installed by zef.

Note it cannot run at all unless this module repo
is installed locally.

Procedures:
+ Insure this repo is committed BEFORE testing
+ Delete the data in META6.json 'resources'
+ Install this repo locally: 
      cd ..; zef install . --debug --force-install
+ Return to this 'dev' dir
+ Execute this program:
      ./installed-resources-testing.raku
