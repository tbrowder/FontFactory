Plan for forming the cross.

The end result should look like Rose Window:

  outer white wheel
  rounded-corner quarter cutouts
    clockwise cuts?
  background stained-glass look
    layers of colors

Make a separate prog just to build the cross from 
  a text file input of cords and color codes
Then play with the assembly till it looks right.
Then integrate it into the main module
  and final product.
